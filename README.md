# EF_LDOR01
Open Source, 3.3 V to 1.8 V, 100 mA Full Regulator 
The EF_LDOR01 is a positive low dropout regulator for
output of 1.8 V. It is capable of supplying 100 mA of output
current with a dropout voltage of 650 mV. Low operating
quiescent current of 115 µA is consumed at no load current.
Moreover, it provides a standard fixed output voltage of 1.8V
which is a good choice for logic power supply. The
EF_LDOR01 requires an output capacitance of 47 μF with a
wide range of ESR (0.1 Ω to 0.5 Ω) for stability. Output
capacitors of this size are typically included in most regulator
designs.
