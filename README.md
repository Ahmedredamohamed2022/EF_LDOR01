## 1. Description
*  The EF_LDOR01 is a positive low dropout regulator for output of 1.8 V. It is capable of supplying 100 mA of output current with a dropout voltage of 650 mV. Low operating quiescent current of 115 µA is consumed at no load current. Moreover, it provides a standard fixed output voltage of 1.8V which is a good choice for logic power supply. The EF_LDOR01 requires an output capacitance of 47 μF with a wide range of ESR (0.1 Ω to 0.5 Ω) for stability. Output capacitors of this size are typically included in most regulator designs.
